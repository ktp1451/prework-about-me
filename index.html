      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am an Interior Deisnger turned Web Designer</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Lived in Michigan most of my life, 
        but now moved back to my birth state of Texas</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I'm an old lazy soul. I love to bake, quilt, embroider, do mixed-media art 
        all while watching my favourite tv shows and movies. I play the occasional video game.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Wokring with animals at a sanctuary and rehabilating them</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Grapevine TX</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>This new career allows me to be able to make a salary where I can begin doing my 
        dream job as a hobby and eventually save enough up to just volunteer when I retire. 
        It also allows me to work from home and foster animals and be with my current furbabies.
